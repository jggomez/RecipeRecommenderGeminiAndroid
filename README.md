A large language model [LLM](https://cloud.google.com/ai/llms?hl=en)  is a statistical language model, trained on a massive amount of data, that can be used to generate and translate text and other content and perform other natural language processing (NLP) tasks. LLMs are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) developed by Google in 2017, and can be trained on billions of text and other content.

Google offers an LLM called Gemini

[Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#sundar-note) is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image, and video.

Gemini API in Android offers access directly from your Android app using the Google AI client SDK for Android. You can use this client SDK if you don't want to work directly with REST APIs or server-side code (like Python) for accessing Gemini models in your Android app.

This is open-source code that uses the Gemini API on Android to recommend recipes with multiple parameters. There is also a parameter to send an image and get recommendations based on it.
